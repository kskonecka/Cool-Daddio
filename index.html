       <h3>ABOUT</h3>
       <p>
         COOL DADDIO: The Second Youth of R. Stevie Moore’ is an upcoming music documentary film
         exploring the life of struggling cult musician, unconventional entertainer and genuine
         eccentric, R. Stevie Moore. It is a project developed, directed and
          by Imogen Putler and Monika Baran.<br>
         Our film began when we met Tennessee-born R. Stevie Moore at one of his London gigs
         in May 2014. The strange sight of a pyjama-wearing grandpa mustering more raw energy on
         stage than most bands a quarter of his age got us immediately hooked, and we began unearthing
         the story of one of America’s most iconoclastic and prolific musicians.<br>
         The “grandfather of DIY home-recording” and genuine cool daddio - a title penned from
         his 1978 song - RSM has remained an underground figure for decades, never reaching out
         to wider audiences.... until recently. In the past few years, his name has become a
         reference point for alternative music fans and at the age of 60, RSM landed two coups:
         he went on his first international tour and appeared on his first magazine cover.
         This recent flurry of media attention has come at an all too critical time in his career:
         ageing, broke and in ill-health, there is a growing sense that this might be a final
         opportunity to recognise the influence of a man far before his time.<br>
         RSM is an incredible man whose compelling story begs to be told to many more people.
         ‘Cool Daddio’ will cast a comprehensive look at RSM, exploring his past and present,
         showcasing his music and art as well as including interviews with numerous contributors,
         including Ariel Pink, Tim Burgess, Mac Demarco, Theophilus London, David Shrigley,
         James Richardson, Jason Falkner and many many more.

        <span>WHO IS R. STEVIE MOORE</span>
        <p>“He’s the best musician ever and of course he’s unknown. Are these things a coincidence?”<br>
            Ariel Pink<br><br>

            Genius, seminal, lo-fi legend, grandfather of DIY music, cult icon:
            all are words frequently used to describe prolific American musician R. Stevie Moore.
            And yet after 40 years of making music and an output of more than 400 albums,
            he has consistently failed to gain mainstream success, instead becoming one of the
            icons of the alternative music scene.<br><br>

            Born on January 18th, 1952 in Nashville, Tennessee, he is the oldest son of Bob Moore,
            veteran Nashville A-Team bassist and a long-time sideman for Elvis Presley,
            Roy Orbison, Patsy Cline and many others. R. Stevie almost certainly inherited
            some of his musical talents from his father, but abandoned the country music scene,
            instead focusing on pursuing his own uncompromising aesthetic and sound, inspired by
            musicians such as Frank Zappa, The Beach Boys and The Beatles.<br><br>

            RSM's body of work epitomises diversity - a concept he vigorously preaches -
            and his music spans multiples genres including pure power-pop, post-punk, indie rock,
            electronic avant-garde and even hip-hop. For many years these were almost exclusively
            available on tape via mail order through his home-based label R. Stevie Moore Cassette Club,
            but the advent of the internet exposed his work to a new generation of fans.<br><br>

            He’s enjoyed critical acclaim from sources such as Rolling Stone magazine,
            Trouser Press and Wire Magazine and has gained a cult following, collaborating with
            Ariel Pink, Tim Burgess, The Vaccines, members of MGMT, XTC and many others. Despite
            his prolific musical output and influence on others, commercial success has eluded
            R. Stevie, making him one of the most overlooked composers, songwriters and
            performers of the past decades.</p>

          After the amazing generosity of our Kickstarter backers, we managed to reach our goal
          and raised £10,444, meaning that we have enough funds to see us through to the next stage
          of filming. Thank you !<br><br>

          We are now using the funds to return to America and complete shooting -
          a quick stop tour of locations including Nashville, LA, Vegas and NYC.
          You can check out our social media pages for more information and to keep updated on
          the goings-on of the film.<br><br>
