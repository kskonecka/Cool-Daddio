         COOL DADDIO: The Second Youth of R. Stevie Moore’ is an upcoming music documentary film
         exploring the life of struggling cult musician, unconventional entertainer and genuine
         eccentric, R. Stevie Moore. It is a project developed, directed and
          by Imogen Putler and Monika Baran.<br>
         Our film began when we met Tennessee-born R. Stevie Moore at one of his London gigs
         in May 2014. The strange sight of a pyjama-wearing grandpa mustering more raw energy on
         stage than most bands a quarter of his age got us immediately hooked, and we began unearthing
         the story of one of America’s most iconoclastic and prolific musicians.<br>
         The “grandfather of DIY home-recording” and genuine cool daddio - a title penned from
         his 1978 song - RSM has remained an underground figure for decades, never reaching out
         to wider audiences.... until recently. In the past few years, his name has become a
         reference point for alternative music fans and at the age of 60, RSM landed two coups:
         he went on his first international tour and appeared on his first magazine cover.
         This recent flurry of media attention has come at an all too critical time in his career:
         ageing, broke and in ill-health, there is a growing sense that this might be a final
         opportunity to recognise the influence of a man far before his time.<br>
         RSM is an incredible man whose compelling story begs to be told to many more people.
         ‘Cool Daddio’ will cast a comprehensive look at RSM, exploring his past and present,
         showcasing his music and art as well as including interviews with numerous contributors,
         including Ariel Pink, Tim Burgess, Mac Demarco, Theophilus London, David Shrigley,
         James Richardson, Jason Falkner and many many more.
